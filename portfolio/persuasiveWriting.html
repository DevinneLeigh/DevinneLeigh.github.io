            <h1>Antibiotics in agriculture: healthcare or greed?</h1>
            <h2>by Devinne McCombs</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Before the discovery of antibiotics, bacterial infections such as cholera, tuberculosis, and bacterial meningitis ravaged humanity. Even the most benign injuries ran the risk of infection and losing a limb. Now in the modern world, we have entirely new plagues. With the discovery of antibiotics many lives were saved, but because we have been too overzealous with them, we have created a new problem— antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, or AMR. According to expert predictions, 10 million people will die each year from AMR by 2050 (“Tackling Drug-Resistant Infections Globally: An Overview of Our Work” O’Neill). By this estimate, in less than 30 years, more people will die from AMR than from cancer. With livestock producers responsible for 70 percent of all antibiotics used in the U.S., they are the main culprit of the problem (“Antibiotics and Animal Agriculture: A Primer” Pew Trusts). So far there has been some initiative to help reduce antibiotic use, but with the amount of antibiotics farms are still using, the fight is far from over.</p>

            <p>In Idaho, livestock makes up roughly 59 percent of agricultural products, making it not only a worldwide problem, but something we must tackle locally (“Ranking of the Most Produced Foods in Idaho” Beef2Live). Livestock farmers may claim they use antibiotics because they are just trying to keep their animals healthy, but that is not what the evidence shows. Meat and dairy producers are pumping antibiotics into livestock for one simple reason— profit.</p>

            <p> Most people know how antibiotics basically work. You take them, and they kill the bad germs that are making you sick. But this is far from the whole story— antibiotics work by attacking all of the bacteria it comes in contact with— the good and the bad. And bacteria are just like any other living organism— they rely on the survival of the fittest. When bacteria encounter an antibiotic, it does not always kill every last one of them, especially when a full dose is not given. Sometimes completely by chance, bacteria are born with a mutation that makes them immune or resistant to that particular antibiotic. Now these immune bacteria are able to rapidly reproduce every 20 minutes until their numbers are replenished again, breeding a new antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Every time bacteria encounters an antibiotic, we run the risk of changing their genes to be resistant to that particular antibiotic (“Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues” Blaser).</p>

            <p>And it doesn’t stop there; on the off chance that only beneficial bacteria had a chance to mutate and reproduce, bacteria can obtain genetic traits from each other. They do this either by picking it up from a dead bacterium, or from a kind of bacterial sex in which the sole purpose is to exchange DNA and not reproduce (“Pathways for Horizontal Gene Transfer in Bacteria Revealed by a Global Map of Their Plasmids” Redondo-Salvo et al.). So the next time a harmful bacterium that is typically seen in meat such as E. coli or salmonella encounters these antibiotic- resistant good bacteria, there is a chance that they can become resistant themselves.</p>

            <p>The meat industry continues to falsely claim that they are not contributing to antimicrobial resistance. More locally, we have the Idaho Beef Council which is an organization that was formed by state legislation to help sell more beef. They would have you believe that antibiotics are only given to cattle when they are sick— and not giving them antibiotics would be cruel ("Antibiotic Use in Cattle” Idaho Beef Council). But according to Martin J. Blaser, the director of the Center for Advanced Biotechnology, the main reason farmers give animals antibiotics is not because of disease; “In fact, they don’t even give their animals full therapeutic doses, the levels that would be used to treat infections. On most factory farms, animals are given food and water treated with low, subtherapeutic dose of an antibiotic” (Blaser 81). If farmers were simply giving antibiotics to animals that are sick, it would not make sense to put it in the food and water that every single animal consumes. The biggest and most important reason that farmers give their animals antibiotics is because it makes them gain more weight on less food. That’s right, we have known since the 1940’s that antibiotics make you gain weight (“Missing Microbes: How the Overuse of Antibiotics is Fueling Our Modern Plagues” Blaser). Since then, countless studies have been performed that have linked frequent antibiotic use (especially when used at a young age) with obesity in both humans and animals. Livestock industries know this, and of course they do all they can to exploit it. It should not be left up to them to do the right thing— their first priority will always be profit— no matter the disastrous cost to the entire world.</p>

            <p>Indeed, meat and dairy producers can technically say they are following the regulations that were passed in 2017 that made giving livestock antibiotics for the sole purpose of growth promotion illegal (“H.R.1587 - Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2017”). But under this law, meat and dairy producers are still able to give “preventative antibiotics” to their animals— effectively letting farmers continue to put antibiotics in feed and water. But if farmers didn’t crowd their animals together— forcing them to live in conditions that are so awful and filthy, then they wouldn’t need to constantly be force-fed antibiotics as a preventative measure.</p>

            <p>The Idaho Beef Council also assures us that since they have a specified time between the last antibiotic dose and the time of slaughter, no antibiotics are in the meat when you purchase it ("Antibiotic Use in Cattle” Idaho Beef Council). But the only reason meat and dairy producers care about antibiotic residue is because it is against the law to sell animal products that contain any (“Drug Residues” FDA). They also completely ignore the real issue that not only is their meat covered with pathogenetic or harmful AMR bacteria, but by their hand, the environment is too.</p>

            <p>Meat companies make it impossible to avoid antibiotics and their manufactured antibiotic resistant pathogens— even swearing off meat and going vegetarian will not help you. In a study that sampled the Snake River, scientists discovered high levels of antibiotics that were put there from livestock runoff manure. The study states that: “... even cropped soils that are not treated with manure are still receiving low-level antibiotics during irrigation events” (“Occurrence of Antibiotics in an Agricultural Watershed in South-Central Idaho” Dungan et al.). Not only are Idaho livestock farmers contaminating the Snake River with antibiotics, but they are contaminating crops with antibiotics because the river is used for irrigation.</p>

            <p>We constantly have food-born illness outbreaks, yet the government refuses to take appropriate action. According to the CDC, there are now multiple different strains of salmonella that are resistant to multiple different antibiotics (“2019 Antibiotic Resistance Threats Report” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). And when outbreaks of dangerous antibiotic- resistant bacteria do occur, meat companies are slow to respond and recall their products, causing more severe illnesses and unnecessary death. When the poultry giant, Foster Farms had a salmonella outbreak that hospitalized forty percent of the over 600 cases, they did not issue a recall until over a year later, and even went so far as to suggest that their chicken had only caused one verified case of salmonella because of legal loopholes (“The Trouble with Chicken” PBS). “Consumer Reports found -- 79.8% of the poultry from retailers contained enterococcus, 65.2% contained E. coli, and 10.8% had salmonella contamination” (Sifferlin). So there is a good chance that the chicken you have in the fridge right now is covered with harmful or possibly deadly bacteria— which may or may not be resistant to antibiotics— making it incredibly difficult for doctors to help you. These meat companies can continue to get away with it because according to current law, salmonella is not considered an “adulterant,” and it is perfectly legal for meat companies to sell their products that contain it, even the extremely dangerous and antibiotic-resistant strains (“The Trouble with Chicken” PBS).</p>

            <p>As individuals, it’s easy to feel helpless in the pursuit of avoiding antibiotics— what can we do to help solve this problem? Well, we can start with both lowering our meat and dairy consumption and avoiding large factory farm meat products as much as possible. Idaho has many great local antibiotic-free farms to choose from. But navigating which companies or farms to choose can be difficult because even when companies claim that antibiotics were not used, that might not necessarily be true. According to Consumer Reports: “Not giving antibiotics to animals raised for meat, poultry, dairy, and eggs is one of the many requirements that food producers must meet to use the Department of Agriculture’s organic seal on their products” (“What 'No Antibiotics' Claims Really Mean” Calvo and Meltzer-Warren). So buying organic meat and dairy products is a pretty safe way to be sure that no animals were raised with antibiotics.</p>

            <p>With the 20.9 million pounds of antibiotics that are given to animals every year, pathogenetic bacteria has ample chance to become resistant to antibiotics (“Antibiotics and Animal Agriculture: A Primer” Pew Trusts). New pathogenetic bacteria are being discovered all the time that are resistant to multiple types of antibiotics. The government must take a stand against the meat and dairy industry and ban the use of antibiotics in livestock unless there is a positive test for a bacterial infection in the intended animal. They also must make regulations on the living conditions of livestock so that bacterial infections are not so easily spread through the literal shit these animals are forced to live in. Nothing will change until the masses are made aware of these issues, and demand change from lawmakers. Giant factory farms will continue to put their greedy wants above the world’s safety until we force them to stop abusing antibiotics.</p>
