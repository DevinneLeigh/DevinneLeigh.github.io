            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>When discussing gene editing, changing human DNA is usually the first thing that comes to mind. However, this is only one of the many applications. Crop resilience from both physical and chemical forces can be obtained through gene editing. Gene editing can be implemented in ways to help the environment recover from human destruction and help combat the ever-encroaching threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Lastly, it can be used for germline editing, or so-called CRISPR babies.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Genetic modification has been happening for over thirty thousand years, since the first farmers selectively bred their crops to produce higher yields (Rangel & Maurer, 2016). Discovered in 2012, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna are the scientists behind the newest gene editing technology called CRISPR, which is an acronym for Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (Hesman Saey, 2020).</p>

            <h3>CRISPR-Cas9</h3>
            <p> CRISPR is naturally occurring and found in about 90 percent of archaea, and 40 percent of bacteria (Davies, 2021, pg. 38). The different types of CRISPR are split into three classes based on their structure and functions. The CRISPR type that is used by scientists to edit DNA is a Cas9 enzyme-containing type II. This Cas9 enzyme works by pairing up with an RNA strand that is an exact match to the DNA which the scientist wishes to remove. Once the RNA finds its match in the DNA containing nucleus, the Cas9 enzyme can cut both strands of the double helix DNA (Davies, 2021, pg. 23). After the DNA strand is cut, the cell will repair the break, oftentimes resulting in disabling the DNA strand altogether, and effectively removing the gene for the targeted genetic disorder.  Alternatively, a new gene can be inserted to replace the old one (Hesman Saey, 2020). These two repairing methods are called non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is used when the desired result is to only disrupt the function of the gene, and not replace it. HDR is used when there is a new genetic code in which to repair the strands (Davies, 2021, pg. 28-29).</p>

            <h3>Gene editing Humans</h3>
            <p>Human gene editing is probably what most people think about when talking about CRISPR. However, there are very few genetic diseases that CRISPR can be used for (Davies, 2021, pg. 322). There is still much research to be done to expand on and refine the CRISPR-cas9 tool. Humans can have their DNA altered before the embryo is even implanted with a technique called germline editing. Only a few rouge scientists have successfully made “CRISPR babies.”  The goal of germline editing is to make the embryo resistant to disease and other genetic mutations. This application has not yet been thoroughly tested to ensure that unintended side effects don’t ensue (Davies, 2021).</p>

            <h3>Gene editing Crops</h3>
            <p>Plants were genetically engineered long before CRISPR was discovered, but CRISPR has enabled it to be done much more easily and efficiently. Using gene modification, crops are made to be resistant to fungi, bacteria, and viruses. They can be made to be more resilient to physical or chemical stressors, insects, and disease (Mutezo et al., 2021). It is all thanks to genetically modified crops that the rising population of the world has been able to produce an adequate food supply.</p>

            <h3>Gene Editing to Save the Environment</h3>
            <p>Gene editing can be used to reduce environmental damage from fossil fuels, pesticides, high water usage, invasive species, and food waste, and be used for bioweapon and pathogen detection, and plastic degradation (Gallegos, 2018). Biofuels are organically created fuels that can be used in place of fossil fuels. Creating them is difficult, but by using CRISPR, the process could be made much simpler by editing the bacteria that are used for fermentation in the last step. By editing the bacteria’s DNA, their metabolic performance can be improved, and they can be given an increased tolerance to the biofuel end product that has become antimicrobial (Javid et al., 2018).</p>

            <h3>Gene editing Pathogens</h3>
            <p>CRISPR can also be used to modify the genetic code of pathogenetic bacteria. As the overuse of antibiotics continues to soar, it gives more bacteria and pathogens the ability to become resistant. It is estimated that there will be 10 million deaths per year from antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) pathogens by the year 2050 (Shabbir et al., 2019). Creating new antibiotics is costly, time-consuming, and only prolongs the inevitable of bacteria once again mutating to form a resistance. However, scientists have discovered that CRISPR cas-9 can target pathogen-specific genes and create antibiotics that will only target AMR pathogens (Shabbir et al., 2019).</p>

            <h3>Ethical concerns</h3>
            <p>There are many different ethical concerns from multiple different perspectives when it comes to gene editing; it is important to take them all into consideration. The ethical lenses this paper will discuss are utilitarianism, egoism, and relativism.</p>

            <h3>Utilitarianism</h3>
            <p>Gene editing lines up with utilitarianism’s beliefs because it has the potential to make the world a better place by eradicating genetic disease, feeding the world, lessening environmental damage, and helping to solve antibiotic resistance. However, in an attempt to benefit the majority, a utilitarian approach fails to consider the plights of minorities</p>

            <h3>Egoism</h3>
            <p>Egoism is the practice of making our moral and ethical decisions based on what is best for our individual selves. It’s easy to imagine all the ways gene editing can help us personally and ignore the negative effects on different groups of people. Scientists may mistakenly believe that erasing genetic disease will solely result in a positive outcome by creating a healthier world in which people live longer lives. But this does not address the fact that there are many people currently living with genetic conditions who are perfectly happy, content, and do not wish to change. It would be a grave mistake to not first address the ripple effects of people who would be negatively affected by gene editing.</p>

            <h3>Eugenics</h3>
            <p>How do we decide which genetic conditions to erase? At what point does it become eugenics? In an interview with Jackie Leach Scully, a Professor of Bioethics and Director of the Disability Innovation Institute, she criticized Denis Rebrikov, a scientist who used CRISPR to reverse genetic deafness for treating a condition that many in the deaf community feel does not need to be reversed because it is a normal human trait rather than a disability (Hasson, 2019). Erasing traits such as deafness could leave thousands of people in the deaf community feeling invalidated for simply existing.</p>

            <h3>Income Inequality</h3>
            <p>With how the United States healthcare system is currently run, genetic modification would most likely only be accessible to the extremely wealthy; only deepening the divide of inequity. This is a concern that must be addressed before gene editing becomes more widespread. It must be noted that this is not an ethical failure of gene editing, but the lack of affordability of healthcare. </p>

            <h3>Relativism</h3>
            <p>It is impossible to answer definitively whether gene editing is ethical because everyone has a different moral code. Some cases of unethical gene editing occurred because there is currently not enough research, yet a scientist decided to go ahead with human trials anyway. One example of this is the case of He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist who successfully implanted two edited embryos, creating “CRISPR babies” (Davies, 2021, pg.14). This was incredibly reckless and dangerous as we do not know what any side effects may be. When considering the ethicality of gene editing, it must be looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>CRISPR technology has the potential to lessen environmental burdens, treat or cure genetic diseases, combat the threat of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and feed the ever-growing world population. Self-serving scientists who take it upon themselves to take risky leaps before the science is sound should not be a detriment to the field. Individuals who do not personally think gene modification is moral should not be allowed to take others’ choices away. We need to take particular care to make genetic modification available to all those who want or need it, not just those who can afford it. We need to put systems in place that keep those with disabilities free of discrimination for simply existing and not choosing to use gene editing. There is still so much to discover in the world of gene editing; it would be unethical to stifle scientific progress that has the potential to do so much good.</p>
