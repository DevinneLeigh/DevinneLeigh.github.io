       <h1>About Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h1>
       <div id="about_wrapper">
            <h2>Your Island Life Begins</h2>
            <p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons, released in March 2020 for the Nintendo Switch, is the fifth main entry in the Animal Crossing series. Developed by Nintendo, the game places players on a deserted island as part of a "getaway package" from Tom Nook. Players customize and develop the island into a thriving community of anthropomorphic animals, gathering resources, crafting items, building infrastructure, and forming social bonds. The real-time simulation features seasonal changes based on the player’s hemisphere, open-ended gameplay, and both local and online multiplayer options.</p>
            <h2>Gameplay Features</h2>
            <p><b>Real-Time Seasons & Weather:</b> The game syncs with your real-world clock and even adjusts to your hemisphere, changing weather and seasonal events accordingly. <b>Crafting & Customization:</b> Players can gather natural materials to craft tools, furniture, and decorations, adding personal flair to their island. <b>Island Design & Terraforming:</b> Advanced customization features like cliffs, rivers, and paths unlock later in the game, allowing for intricate island layouts. <b>Multiplayer & Amiibo:</b> Up to 8 players can visit one island online. Amiibo cards and figures can also invite favorite characters to join your island life.</p>
            <h2>Development & Design Philosophy</h2>
            <p>Directed by Aya Kyogoku, development began in 2012 with the goal of welcoming both longtime fans and newcomers. The crafting system was added to provide more things to do, especially after in-game shops closed at night. The visuals follow a philosophy called the “imagination gap”—a simple, warm art style that invites players to project their own creativity onto the world.</p>
            <p>The developers also addressed long-standing player habits. Landscaping was introduced so players wouldn’t feel pressured to restart their games just to get the “perfect” island. To discourage excessive time-traveling, events were tied to real-time updates rather than preloaded content.</p>
            <h2>Reception & Impact</h2>
            <p>New Horizons received widespread acclaim for its charm, freedom, and cozy atmosphere. Critics praised the Nook Miles system, the crafting mechanics, and the vast opportunities for self-expression. It received widespread critical acclaim and won multiple awards, including “Best Family Game” at The Game Awards and honors from BAFTA and the D.I.C.E. Awards. It holds the highest Metacritic score of any game in the series and has sold over 47 million copies—making it the best-selling Animal Crossing game and one of the top-selling games of all time.</p>
            <p>However, it’s not without flaws. Some players were frustrated by early game pacing, and only one island is allowed per Switch console, limiting family sharing. While the real-time mechanics create a relaxing experience, they can also lead to slow progress for those who don’t time travel. The game also ended its major updates in November 2021, leaving some longtime fans wanting more content.</p>
            <h2>A Game That Brought Us Together</h2>
            <p>Whether you’re showing off your meticulously designed island or hosting a wedding for friends during quarantine, New Horizons created a space where players could connect, relax, and share joy. It’s a game about creativity, community, and celebrating the small things in life—and it continues to inspire fan art, stories, online markets, and entire communities like ours.</p>
